# nRF2401-motors

This sketch is used to test and debug communications with a joystick module using nRF24L01 radios.  It sets the specified motor speed and direction, as well as reporting the received packet information.  It is intended to be used with an Adafruit MotorShield (version 2), but for testing communications, it will work without, only reporting the information to the Serial Monitor.

This sketch is one possible remote end to go with the [nRF2401-Joy2](https://github.com/WCRSyyc/nRF2401-Joy2.git) joystick module testing code.
